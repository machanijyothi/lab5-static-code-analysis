# Lab 5 â€“ Static Code Analysis

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for **Lab 5: Static Code Analysis**.  
The goal is to perform static analysis on a Python file using tools like **Pylint**, **Flake8**, and **Bandit**, identify issues, fix them, and reflect on the improvements.
